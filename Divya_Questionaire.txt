Use ROW_NUMBER(if you want a single) or DENSE_RANK(for all related rows):

WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT EmpID, EmpName, EmpSalary,
           RN = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY EmpSalary DESC)

)

difference b/w interface and abstract
difference b/w windows and web based applications
The first and the foremost difference between Windows and Web Application, Windows application gets installed on a Windows based operating system whereas the web application is installed on a web server.
Windows application can only be accessed from a system in which it is installed. A web application can be accessed from any system through internet.
You need an Internet Information Services (IIS) server to run the web application. Windows application can directly be executed on a windows operating system.
Windows applications can only be run on a windows platform. Web Application can run on a variety of platform including Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, Android, etc.
If designed for a 64-bit operating system, a Windows application won’t work on the 16-bit system. Web application is independent of the type of system.

* Difference between Sp and function
* Can a static method be in abstract class
Yes, Static Method can be called from abstract method. Object of abstract class can't 
be created but to call static object is not required. 
So Static method can be called from abstract class.

abstract methods should be implemented but not non abstract methods
